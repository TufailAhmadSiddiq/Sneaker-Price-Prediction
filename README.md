The datset is loaded, transformed, and preprocessed according to the need of a regression model. The Linear Regression model is trained on prepared dataset. In evaluation, the model shows 0.27 error and predict the Sale Prices. The Flask REST API is developed with required web interface which provides a GUI to user to make prediction.
